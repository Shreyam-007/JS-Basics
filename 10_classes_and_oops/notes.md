# javascript and classes
JavaScript introduced a class syntax in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to make it easier to work with object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. However, it's important to note that JavaScript's classes are syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance system. In other words, JavaScript's class syntax provides a more familiar and structured way to define and work with objects, but under the hood, it still uses prototypes.

So, while JavaScript has a class syntax, it doesn't have traditional classes in the same sense as languages like Java or C++. Instead, JavaScript's classes are a more convenient way to work with its prototype-based system. They provide a clear and concise way to define constructor functions and methods for objects, making JavaScript's OOP features more accessible to developers who are familiar with class-based languages.
